Good Karma Farmer. 
In between India and SF reforming education networks to build powerful companies. 
Currently focused on tech/Ai.
Using it daily as my 2nd brain :)
We provide the lowest cost CPM marketing in all of the internet.

"Louis Barclay yes it is :) I think you made a good chart, I want to have one showing the new paradigm switch I’m speaking on :)"
"
Casual how to build AGI paper link"
Awesome!
LFG
Excited about what we create together.
Looking forward to seeing you help the world do less meaningless work. We are going to do great things.
Looking forward to seeing you grow into an amazing leader.
Excited For The Future Of Pillai.
Keep up the good work Marc.
"We have the minds of apes and the technology of gods. We must point this technology towards our higher selves, and not towards the extraction of our lifeforce for ad revenue maximization."
Keep up the good work.
Sorry to hear.
"Hey there. I saw your 3000mg being offered for $117. I just wanted to offer our white label services to make this product for you for $9 a pop so you can stay competitive in the market, and still keep amazing margins."
The chillbars are sooooo good.
Excited about the future of Ai content creation to create bloomscrolling.
Thanks for having me :) Youtube video of the talk here. On Persist's model of building a bridge to dark talent (founder potential) and the ecosystem of startups I've brought together.
"
In summary;
We all know legacy media -> creator economy -> attention meritocracy"
"Enjoyed speaking about meme coins, shared belief systems, and the future of finance with the man Brock Pierce wearing our Meme Lords shirts, our stealth venture."
And it will become more and more common knowledge that we are going through the 
legacy finance -> token economy -> shared belief system meritocracy
"1.4 Billion views for myself on gifs. 

Showed that Im the top gif when you search ""presidency"" to the RFK team and now we're running their channel, massive cultural awareness on RFK incoming.

Who controls the memes controls the universe - Elon Musk"
"The rate at which persistent people can learn, and create a niche app is unlike ever before. I've hired over 60 people this past year without looking at a single resume or doing an interview. "
We simply give a challenge to build a full MVP of the startup we are looking to create and let thousands of people compete for salary + equity!
"Its what I wish I had access to compete in when I was young, and its amazing to bring it to life now. "
"I first applied to Thiel Fellowship with Jim O'Neill in 2017, and to be on the other side, helping to find undiscovered talent is incredible. Jim is an amazing human and bouncing board for ideas and direction and I cant wait to touch down in SF in two weeks to work more closely together."
3D Render of the first order of our home robot we've got in production. First unit at the end of nest month :) 
The greatness of persistence and belief will continue to rise in value. Swapnil Sharma has been an amazing leader of the OvaDrive Ai 2nd brain project and continues to impress me with his hard work and willingness to tackle new hard problems. 
Bullish on this team.
"The future of social, solving the present problem of Ai alignment. Engagement algorithm -> Inspiration Algorithm"

More on the solution here: 
Underhyped release. Underhyped capabilities. Foresight has never been more valuable and the value of it is going exponential.
Important work. New institutions to help the visionaries take flight with their visions. 
One thing I stole from Nick that was very well said “I want to raise as many people up Maslov’s hierarchy of needs as possible”
Social media today will be looked at as the cigarettes of our generation. We have god-like technology aimed at our minds to try and engage with us at all costs.
"We platform crazy, and filter the globes information towards the bottom of the brainstem. "
"This is the source of controversy, and probably so much more. Really excited about Empowerverse and the idea of flipping that paradigm on its head."
This next step in computer evolution will be obvious in 2 years.
Check it out! 
"55k for a friend from our free grant search software. We also cover the filing! Paid 4.5k to the person who simply told them to fill out the form on our website. If you know lots of business owners, get them to spend 60 seconds filling out 6 basic company questions to see if they qualify for any government grants."
"It’s been a while since I’ve completed my PHD in Dropping Out, Completed After 1 Year, at University of Arizona. "
My deal with my parents was that if I could start having my business make more money than them they'd not disown me for going and being an entrepreneur ??
"Realistically this should've gotten funding like crazy and we would have changed our buy limits, but venture capital was so foreign to me I did not a single soul who had raised funding. Now that Im in SF its an entirely different story."
"I actually did that with Betarian, my cryptocurrency exchange but shut it down after losing my entire savings and profit from a organized crime attack which used fake American Passports to sign up accounts in the name of stolen bank accounts. That was 2017 and I had done half a million in revenue in the matter of months as the first place to offer Paypal to Ethereum. "
This is inefficient...
"Switching the dynamic, and reaching out to potentially great founders and finding a way to de-risk their path is such a better methodology for venture capital. It's what I just recently did for Thaneem Rayan to run Employer Grants. "
"Proof of this failure is being scouted by many colleges for football, flown out, etc for an industry that makes far less money than intrinsic innovation. Yet making half a million in web3 before it was even a big thing got 0 inflow"
"Not ever thinking of returning to school now that I'd tasted success of creating something I ended up starting a new business from scratch... from my fraternity house, which scaled into a manufacturing business called Cannafacturer which I sold to Taylor St Group in 2022. "
The past few months I've been putting together a team of Ai researchers with the end goal of automating all remote work.
A couple weeks ago I sent a video off to an editor explaining why this fundamental path forward is one of the most exciting in terms of building a company today. 
"I also believe this capability display is necessary to existentially accelerate the world on the power of Ai, building our collective resilience by furthering the conversation on the implications of the rise of computational based intelligence beyond our understanding."
Building this company is massive fuel for the non-profit companies I've seeded the past coupled years and the Systemic Altruism movement at large.
"That being said, if you know any strong Ai candidates, send them my way. We are actively hiring for Workplete"
"A week ago Sam Altman said that this space is the most exciting to him, and I couldn't agree more."
"Potentially the closest project I'll get to operating a government contract. The US Treasury printed over 400B to offer as a covid stimulus, to employers with W-2 employees during 2020, and 2021 and recently increased the qualifying eligibility for employers and extended filing timelines till 2025."
"The video linked below is my friend Jean Paul who after a single phone call we helped him file for $266,000. Looking to bring on board great cold outreach growth hackers."
Just got featured on Yahoo Finance for my year old baby Cannafacturer!
"We have been lurking in the shadows for a bit. Committing to quality for our existing contracts and preparing ourselves to scale and now it's time to get the word out. $80 1000mg tincture companies should be shaking in their boots. We are offering 2000mg at $5 labeled, shipped, and sealed."
Happy to work together in our outreach and offer 10% commission off revenue of new manufacturing contracts brought by us!

You want a Pisa this?
One pickup line and we hooked up immediately. She was extra salty with my dinner choice.
Humbled to say my site has reached the #1 rank for organic Buying Ethereum with PayPal related searches. It is the only automated PayPal ?? ETH exchange on the Internet right now. Figured I should show where a lot of my time has been spent the last two months.
Scaling faster than I could’ve ever expected.
"A lot of my friends have fallen to the white powder??, I’m above it #flexwiththeice"
"Six months ago I met Paul Nordstrom who invited me to their Masonic lodge. There I have continued to meet Individuals who have shared invaluable knowledge and perspective. One of the men here is Jerry who helps lead the Masonic Foundation for @ risk children (See the tapestry in the left of the photo). I’ve been volunteering my time with him to help implement digital automation into the charity, to decrease their work-load."
"Quitting video games and using my time wisely was one of the best changes I made in life, it’s opened many doors and will no doubt have a butterfly effect on the future of my life. Happy to have become an entered apprentice of freemasonry."
"Keep in mind the rates of change and the levels of things, and the relationships between them ;)"

"Dopamine decides whether a task is fun, or a chore. In the video I explain a life changing perspective I gained when doing a dopamine fast."

"It will be interesting to see how the future unfolds, I think we can all be certain that within our lifetime, things will get weird."
Keep expanding peoples consciousness and deepening their souls. Congrats on 1m @pursuitofwonder
"A few months ago I took my business from my garage & guest house to a warehouse. I’m glad social media can bring awareness to the unconventional routes of income and hope this can serve as a backing to those thinking of dropping out of college and pursuing a different route. Just be ready to work hard, delete social media unless it’s part of your business, skip out on invites, and stay true to what you know is best. When I dropped out my parents cut off the financial backing I had for school (rent, food, etc) at the time I was upset but looking back I’m happy they did because it didn’t allow complacency. When I dropped out I was still living in my fraternity house. "
"What a distracting environment to run a startup, when I distanced myself from that lifestyle I was finally able to really point myself in the right direction. (Got my reward system rewarding the right things, not the juul, or a hookup, or a beer at 10am on a Monday) Your environment heavily influences your actions, so choose it wisely. That includes the people you follow digitally too. I hope to start spreading a positive message and opening people up to new perspectives. It’s the easiest thing to want to flex or get clout, which in some aspect plays a role in spreading positive change. People are more likely to listen if they look up to you, but there’s a balance which I hope to continue to improve on for the future."
What’s the best way to gamble money in Vegas? A booth at a trade show. They charge you up the wazoo but the amount of money exchanged at the shows is staggering. Met some great people like @garynangel and @rawkandroll . Pre-black plague of course. I continue to optimize this business and will delegate myself out of it soon.
I identify as a Bloomsday/Prepper.
"I hope you who cross by these vibes let them not just be another random string of information consumed throughout the day, but let it be portal into a newer, better timeline which every moment has the potential for."
"Its crazy to think that we live with entirely different versions of our instagram friends and followers based on our actions, and even based on the things we post."
"Small butterfly effects, which ripple in their lives, and humanities story."
"I wonder if the day when Superintelligent Ai evolves enough for us to see what a version of the world would look like without someone in it, we would even care to check…"
I think that comes with No Judgement day.
"But until then we should judge our actions, and make it one's goal to make the one with ourselves in it far better."
"I've thought bout these things since I was young, but ultimately suppressed some of it to fit in."
"I wish I learned not to doubt my vibes sooner, so if you reading this and ever doubt yours, let the portal I spoke of be to not."
"Tell yourself ""I love myself"" and reprogram that subconscious bb."
"The crazy future I thought I may get to see, came much quicker than expected. I used to think i was fighting for my life, now my lifetime seems far longer than needed for longevity escape velocity."
Things this next decade will truly get… different.
Tech is going exponential.
"But LOOK UP.As tech goes exponential in power, our virtues go exponential in value."
"Theres never been a better time to dream, and no time and space with quite as much meaning as the moment we are in now."
"So dream big, then bring it back down to Earth and make it happen."
Let’s have a fucking day becoming our best selves ??
BTW If you are free on 4/20/2042 Im trowing a party on the moon. I understand if you already have plans.
Excited to share some exciting life updates soon.
Turning conversations about the future with @brockjpierce into poetic verse.
"From Flic, to Socialverse, to Empowerverse. My journey of thinking about the future of social media has been one of continued insights."
"The solution is simple in essence, maximize value for users to turn the device into a true device rather than THE vice."
"A collective of people sorting a feed of videos based on the highest vibe has never been done, but its transformational capability is obvious."
"The root, the core, of our global nervous system are these feeds."
What if we made one that maximizes individual spirit and will?
You can try a version of this “bloom scroll”. By searching that on google play or IOS.
Soon I’ll launch a much bigger campaign aligning this work and others.
Working till sunrise to make sure my son set.
You didn’t serve me dinner but I’ll still give you this tip:
"Your goal should be to believe in and spread the fact that as a species in general, our fate is up in the air. By that I mean Humanity may die before it ever expands to the stars or we could leave this planet with a lack of any consciousness capable of experiencing the beauty that lays here, and it’s up to us to collectively decide that future."
"We may already be doomed, but one thing that is for sure, is that if we unite together and change society to view this problem as THE problem. We have a much higher chance than without doing so."
"With the right propaganda, the right emotional media, and the right support we can make that change for the better."
Life so suite I feel like Cody….
I often think in my shower so I bought hundreds of waterproof notepads to make sure I don’t let great ideas down the drain. Good ideas give me dopamine…
Dopamine is dope. (it rewards you for progressing towards your goals)
Artificial sources of dopamine are wack. They reward you even when you don’t progress.
In the next few decades humans will not need to worry about progress because an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will remove the need for humans to do the work.
"AGI is when robots become as smart a humans. It may be hard to fathom now, but soon we will begin to see Ai create art and chat fluently and then even make videos. It will be able to self-replicate, effectively giving limitless human potential to craft and create in the world."
The risk here is the owner of this power having malevolent intent.
"Given the people of this world, on average, have positive intent collectively we should all have access to this power and not be oppressed by one person who controls the narrative."
"I am not worried about our capability as humans to save the world from natural gasses pollution, because I believe in the power of our ability for exponential innovation. Instead I worry about a central party gaining mass control of our future, and not acting with intent of a better life for all humans on earth."
"For the most part, the masses do not think about the future that is hurtling towards us. Our existing incumbent social platforms push the MOST ENGAGING content through hidden algorithms that we have no control over. These centralized systems are built to PROFIT the most to their private investors from their existence."
"The era of web3 offers a new era for users to own the platforms, for algorithms to be transparent to the users, and for content to be ranked by users in terms of what should be shared to the world rather than what will cause the most engagement which often comes from videos that engage most with our limbic system (often referred to as the monkey ?? brain ??."
I have chosen my path to be one which pushes forward this revolution of algorithms that empower us.

I don’t drink but I’m glad others find utility in relinquishing their inhibitions and allowing themselves to be free from social anxiety and fear.
I do want to push others to push back towards what I think of as a crutch in learning to kill social anxiety but I understand and am grateful for the unique path and knowledge I’ve acquired that’s allowed me to do so.
"I wonder how more people can be pushed into this frame of thought and how we can reshape culture to empower those thinking in the same mindset, where currently it’s a upstream battle to be someone who does not drink."
"I think the more leaders and attention sorcerers who promote this fact, and lifestyle choice, the more who will think of this choice as a positive action and the more who will be empowered to make the change."
I think we need more massive influencers who promote healthy choices and greater perspectives.
